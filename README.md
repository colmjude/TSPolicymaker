A Single Page App for Tiddlyspace that allows a member of a space to edit the policy of the bags comprising the space through a simple interface.

### Run Dev
To run the the SPA locally you need to have **node**, **grunt** (currently v0.3) and **tsapp** installed in your environment.

You can get **tsapp** by running
`pip install -U tsapp`

Once you have these things install run the command
`grunt update-tsapp`

This will put the necessary files in the **dev** folder, cd into this folder and run
`tsapp serve` to run the SPA. It can be accessed at **0.0.0.0:8080/policymaker.html**
